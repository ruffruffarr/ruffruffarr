- 😄 Pronouns: prefer not to say 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on my portfolio website here: https://ruffruffarr.github.io/
- Reading list: Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Learning Python (Mark Lutz) (skim it with Corey Schafer on YouTube: to the point Python) ++ Intro to Python (CS50 Harvard EdX) (difficult but the problem sets and lectures helps) (thanks to @dancikmad for the rec)
