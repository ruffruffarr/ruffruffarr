- 👋 Hi, I’m @ruffruffarr
- 👀 I’m interested in LLMs and AI 
- 💎 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things 
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't think it'd be safe to leave my deets here 
- 😄 Pronouns: prefer not to say 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on my portfolio website here: https://ruffruffarr.github.io/
  
- 📖 Reading list: Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Learning Python (Mark Lutz) (skim it with Corey Schafer on YouTube: to the point Python) ++ Intro to Python (CS50 Harvard EdX) (difficult but the problem sets and lectures helps) (thanks to @dancikmad for the rec)
