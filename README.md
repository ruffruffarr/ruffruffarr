- 👋 Hi, I’m @ruffruffarr
- 👀 I’m interested in LLMs and AI 
- 💎 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things 
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't think it'd be safe to leave my deets here 
- 😄 Pronouns: prefer not to say 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on my portfolio website here: https://ruffruffarr.github.io/
- 📖 Reading list: Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Learning Python (Mark Lutz) (skim it with Corey Schafer on YouTube: to the point Python) ++ Intro to Python (CS50 Harvard EdX) (difficult but the problem sets and lectures helps) (thanks to @dancikmad for the rec)
- 🌱 "It’s important to have a 'growth mindset' about programming—in other words, understand that people develop programming skills through practice. They aren’t just born as programmers, and being unskilled at programming now is not an indication that you can never become an expert."
